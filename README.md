# TDL-Initialization-Project

TODO:
- Implement function for accuracy and plotting against other models
- Implement Gaussian and Xavier initializations
- Play with num_workers
- Hyperparameter tuning for learning rate and (maybe) num conv channels in rectangular region
- Compare models at different depth scales
- Refactor CNN?
